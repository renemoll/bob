Bob the developer's documentation
=================================

Bob is a tool to assist with software development. For every project I would end up
copying and adjusting a set of scripts which helped me building, testing and verifying
my code. Bob is the accumelation of these scripts poured into a proper command line
application.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section on how to use Bob.
