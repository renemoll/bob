Bob the developer's documentation
=================================

Bob is a tool to assist with software development. For every project I would end up
copying and adjusting a set of scripts which help me compiling, testing and verifying
my code. Bob is the accumelation of these scripts poured into a proper command line
application.

My goal with Bob is to create a simple interface to perform tasks I repeat a lot. To
keep the interface simple, the amount of options (both on the command line as in the
configuration file) are limited.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section on how to use Bob.
